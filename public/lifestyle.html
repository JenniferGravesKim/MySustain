                        <div class="microbeads-text-box">Climate is the average weather within a certain area. The term "climate change" has gained momentum in recent years as scientists find more and more evidence of its connection with human actions. The effects of climate change include both rising temperatures and sea levels, the warming and acidification of the world's oceans, and the melting of ice. Climate change not only affects humans through an increase in storms and flooding, but also animals as the habitats of various species are becoming unsuitable for them. A way to reduce one's impact on an aspect of climate change, global warming, would be to utilize renewable energy sources in place of fossil fuels and to consume less meat, particularly beef.</div>

                        <div class="microbeads-text-box-2">Pollution from everyday traffic and industry can lead to numerous health implications, the most notable being respiratory, such as asthma or lung cancer. The burning of fossil fuels leads to the creation of particulate matter and smog, both of which are inhaled from the air. Other than respiratory related consequences, pollution has been also linked to cardiovascular and developmental issues. Water pollution, on the other hand, can harm the endocrine and reproductive systems of both humans and wildlife with the presence of pesticide and heavy metals.</div>

                        <div class="microbeads-text-box-3">Not only do spills negatively impact profits of oil companies, they also harm surrounding wildlife. Most animals harmed by oil spills are those that reside near the surface of the water, such as otters and birds. With these animals in particular, the oil disrupts the protective layer they rely on for survival. If the spill is not taken care of efficiently, the oil can spread onshore and affect terrestrial species as well. Ways to prevent contributing to oil spills are to reduce the use of fossil fuels and instead increase the use of renewable energy sources.</div>
