                <div class="microbeads-text-box">Microbeads are small pieces of plastic (about two millimeters or less in diameter) that are often found in cleansers, soaps, and toothpaste. Products containing microbeads can be identified by their ingredient lists. Polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and polymethyl methacrylate are all forms of microbeads. Microbeads go down your drain and eventually make their way into the world's oceans. The microbeads, which have the ability to absorb pollutants in the environment, are also ingested by fish and other aquatic life. Alternatives for microbeads include wax-based or silica-based beads, both of which are biodegradable.</div>

                <div class="microbeads-text-box-2">Sunscreens are used to block out UV rays from the sun. The two types of radiation that sunscreen prevents are UVA, which is associated with sagging and wrinkling in the skin, and UVB, which is known to cause skin cancer. Many commercial sunscreens share certain ingredients that can harm the body, including otocrylene, avobenzone, oxybenzone, and octisalate. These ingredients have the ability to mimic hormones in the body and may disrupt the endocrine system. Alternatives to these ingredients include sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium oxide, both which effectively block UV radiation without any effect on the body.</div>

                <div class="microbeads-text-box-3">Animal testing has been a part of the production of cosmetics for centuries. Common practices within testing include injections, radiation exposure, and surgicial procedures. As a result of these practices, tens of millions of animals die each year. The development of new technologies has essentially eradicated the need for companies to experiment upon animals for the development of their products. There is also the risk that a product may potentially cause harm, as there is no guarantee the reaction in humans will mirror that of other animals. The alternatives to animal testing are those directed towards experimentation of humans themselves, such as cell or tissue testing. As a consumer, animal testing can be avoided by purchasing products from cruelty free companies.</div>
