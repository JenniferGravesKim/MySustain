                <div class="microbeads-text-box">Overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than can naturally be replenished, resulting in a shortage within the fish industry. Billions of people across the world consume fish regularly, placing a large responsibility on the industry to meet the demand. The current rate of fishing is over two times what the oceans are able to support, making it increasingly unsustainable. Not only are fish affected by overfishing, but other marine life are as well, including dolphins, sharks, and turtles. These animals make up what is known as bycatch, "byproducts" that are caught in nets alongside fish. Certain fishing methods, such as trawling, can even harm the ocean floor and other parts of marine ecosystems. Decreasing the effects of overfishing would require a decrease in the demand for fish, which would occur by decreasing one's own consumption and opting for alternatives.</div>

                <div class="microbeads-text-box-2">Within the modern food industry, artificial ingredients are more common than the average consumer may think. Products that are purely artificial are well permitted to claim being "natural" on packaging and labels, as the term natural (according to the FDA) simply means edible. Although certain ingredients are synthetic throughout their entire lifetime, theres are some ingredients that contradict this. An artificial ingredient can be derived from natural sources, while a supposedly natural ingredient can be derived from artificial sources. Even natural ingredients can have a negative impact on health, such as the toxic chemical cyanide, found in raw almonds.</div>

                <div class="microbeads-text-box-3">While consumers often first see meat when it's in its packaged state, there is an entire process behind how it is obtained. Chickens are packed into sheds, pigs are left in crates, calves are taken away from their mothers, and so on. These practices make up what is known as factory farming, or rather the concept of raising animals in unnatural living conditions, albeit how unethical some might perceive it to be. Billions of animals are put through these practices each year, the majority of them chickens. Animals are often injected with hormones and antibiotics to make them grow at faster rates than what is natural for them, harming their health and debilitating them.</div>
